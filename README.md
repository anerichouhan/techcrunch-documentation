# Revamping the TechCrunch Website - Aneri Chouhan

## Introduction

[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/) is a popular Technology and Business website that enables users to stay up to date with the **latest news** and events happening in the world. It connects users with news articles, provides daily and weekly newsletters, shares information about events happening in the technology and business worlds, and even has a premium subscription called Extra Crunch. 

While the website has several pieces of information and many features, it is not fully organized in a way that makes it easy for users to find what they are looking for. As a Technology lover myself I was fascinated by the opportunity to make the TechCrunch experience better. I chose to explore how we could connect users with the information they love faster, and in an easier and more convenient manner.

## Design Statement
How might we structure the content of TechCrunch and build interactions that enable users to **connect with the information** they need and love **faster** and in a **simpler** more **enjoyable** way? My project will focus on understanding what users seek on TechCrunch and creating a UX that aligns with those needs as well as Nielsonâ€™s 10 Heuristics. My goal is to create a user experience that enables users to successfully find the content they are looking for and enjoy the process of consuming and interacting with the content.

## Competitor analysis
In order to understand the product more in depth and identify areas of focus, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the site. A heuristic evaluation aims to examine key UX principles to assess the usability of the website. It is usually performed by an expert who evaluates the website on each heuristic gives a severity rating to show the priority of fixing elements examined under each heursistic.

While a heuristic evaluation is certainly helpful in ucovering usbability issues, there is a lot of value in observing users directly use the website. I conducted a moderated usability test that included specific tasks and survey questions. I conducted the test on my personal laptop and recorded the particpant's performance and facial expressions. As I moderated the Usability Test, I guided the particpant through the Google Form Questionnaire and encouraged them to think out loud throughout. 

I assigned the particpant three specifc tasks with the goal of observing their behavior and interaction with the website as they navigated the site. The purpose of the study was to uncover issues with usability, and discoverability on the website. By oberserving user behavior, my goal is to identify gaps in the website's UX that should be worked on in order to provide a better overall user experience.

## Contextual Inquiry
In order to further understand the needs, motivations, and pains of my users better, I conducted in depth user interviews one of which can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ft6Ay2HC54sZkmZsTwueJcfxWOrvhDBiCGFAizyuGI/edit?usp=sharing) 
I opted for a remote user interview with participitory observation. I framed a set of questions to understand the overall context, motivations, and behaviors of my target user. I also asked them to share their screen as I observed their interaction with online content. [Read more...](https://github.com/anerichouhan/dh150-assignment04/blob/master/README.md)

## Personas & Scenarios
Storytelling is an important part of User Experience as it fosters empathy and provides clarity on the journey a user goes through. The next step in my process was to document the motivations, needs, and pains uncovered through the contextual interviews into personas and scenarios. I consolidated 5 of my user interviews into personas, empathy maps, scenarios, and journey maps to communicate the insights I gained through user research. I came up with 3 of each and associated them with key tasks to be accomplished through the website. [Read more...](https://github.com/anerichouhan/dh150-personas)

## Low fidelity Wireframes
![Wireflow 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anerichouhan/lowfi_wireflows/master/IMG_0411.JPG)
The next step was to scketch up some ideas on what the website flows could look like and how different screens would connect to each other. I also tested the lowfidelity wireframe with the user to gauge if there were issues with it. You can read more [here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anerichouhan/lowfi_wireflows/master/README.md) I realized that the low fidelity wireframes I drew out could be developed more before I dove into making my hi fidelity mock ups. So I re did my wireframes using a tool called whimsical.

## High Fidelity Wireframes
After combining the feedback I received on the wireframes, I started designing GUIs. I went through several iterations and the final version can be found [here.](https://www.figma.com/proto/V0V8dwrWILpboToyAR4MYm/TechCrunch?node-id=12%3A4&viewport=-184%2C-712%2C0.3589796721935272&scaling=min-zoom)

The purpose of these high fidelity wireframes was to visualize new features like categorization of articles under tech topics and saving articles to a personal library.I went through several rounds of iterations and kept asking users around me for feedback to improve upon my designs. The prototype submitted provides users to do the following tasks:

***Tasks***
1. View News of the Day articles quickly as soon as one opens the site
2. Search for articles through systematic categorization. Ex: View all Attificial Intelligence articles in one place
3. Save or bookmark articles to a personal library where the user can view all their saved content (even in catrgories)
4. (EXTRA TASK) Subscribe to newsletters of the user's choice

## Evaluation and Revision History

Throughout the process, I conducted usability tests and impression tests. I did not video record all but here are some of the key tests that I conducted.

Over time key changes included: 

- Reordering the labels of the nav bar
- Changing the tech categories layout
- Adding the text "TechCrunch" underneath logo
- Implement Next buttons at the end of article
- Added done and clear filter buttons for filters
- Implemented a drop shadow in the top nav bar
- Eliminated some extra steps in flows
- Ensure better wireframe connectivity

## Conclusion
On the whole, I had a great experience with redesigning the Techcrunch website. Systematically going through the design and research process developed my skills of empathzing with users and defining clear problem statements that can be iteratively solved. I learned several new skills and especially loved learning how to conduct cognitive walkthroughs, and assessing accessibility. While designing my screens, I realized how important it is to focus on specific tasks indvidually than to try and address multiple problems at once. While starting off, I felt slightly overwhelmed trying to tackle the whole website at once. But once I identified important parts and prioritized my features I was able to focus well. I thoroughly enjoyed involving users in the design process and learning how to adapt my designs as I built them. 

All in all, this was a super fun project to work on!
