# Revamping the TechCrunch Website - Aneri Chouhan

## Introduction

TechCrunch is a popular Technology and Business website that enables users to stay up to date with the latest news and events happening in the world. It connects users with news articles, provides daily and weekly newsletters, shares information about events happening in the technology and business worlds, and even has a premium subscription called Extra Crunch. While the website has several pieces of information and many features, it is not fully organized in a way that makes it easy for users to find what they are looking for. As a Technology lover myself I was fascinated by the opportunity to make the TechCrunch experience better. I chose to explore how we could connect users with the information they love faster, and in an easier and more convenient manner.

## Design Statement
How might we structure the content of TechCrunch and build interactions that enable users to connect with the information they need and love faster and in a simpler more enjiyable way? My project will focus on understanding what users seek on TechCrunch and creating a UX that aligns with those needs as well as Nielsonâ€™s 10 Heuristics. My goal is to create a user experience that enables users to successfully find the content they are looking for and enjoy the process of consuming and interacting with the content.

## Competitor analysis
In order to understand the product more in depth and identify areas of focus, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the site. A heuristic evaluation aims to examine key UX principles to assess the usability of the website. It is usually performed by an expert who evaluates the website on each heuristic gives a severity rating to show the priority of fixing elements examined under each heursistic.

While a heuristic evaluation is certainly helpful in ucovering usbability issues, there is a lot of value in observing users directly use the website. I conducted a moderated usability test that included specific tasks and survey questions. I conducted the test on my personal laptop and recorded the particpant's performance and facial expressions. As I moderated the Usability Test, I guided the particpant through the Google Form Questionnaire and encouraged them to think out loud throughout. I assigned the particpant three specifc tasks with the goal of observing their behavior and interaction with the website as they navigated the site. The purpose of the study was to uncover issues with usability, and discoverability on the website. By oberserving user behavior, my goal is to identify gaps in the website's UX that should be worked on in order to provide a better overall user experience.

## Contextual Inquiry
In order to further understand the needs, motivations, and pains of my users better, I conducted an in depth user interview that can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ft6Ay2HC54sZkmZsTwueJcfxWOrvhDBiCGFAizyuGI/edit?usp=sharing) I opted for a remote user interview with particpirory observation. I framed a set of questions to understand the overall context, motivations, and behaviors of my target user. I also asked them to share their screen as I observed their interaction with online content.[Read more](https://github.com/anerichouhan/dh150-assignment04/blob/master/README.md)

## Personas & Scenarios
Storytelling is an important part of User Experience as it fosters empathy and provides clarity on the journey a user goes through. The next step in my process was to document the motivations, needs, and pains uncovered through the contextual interviews into personas and scenarios. I consolidated 5 of my user interviews into personas, empathy maps, scenarios, and journey maps to communicate the insights I gained through user research. I came up with 3 of each and associated them with key tasks to be accomplished through the website. [Read more...](https://github.com/anerichouhan/dh150-personas)

## Low fidelity Wireframes
The next step was to scketch up some ideas on what the website flows could look like and how different screens would connect to each other. I also tested the lowfidelity wireframe with the user to gauge if there were issues with it.You can read more [here.](https://github.com/anerichouhan/lowfi_wireflows/blob/master/README.md)

## High Fidelity Wireframes
After combining the feedback I received on the wireframes, I started designing GUIs. I went through several iterations and the final version can be found [here.](https://www.figma.com/proto/V0V8dwrWILpboToyAR4MYm/TechCrunch?node-id=12%3A4&viewport=-184%2C-712%2C0.3589796721935272&scaling=min-zoom)
