# Revamping the TechCrunch Website - Aneri Chouhan

## Introduction

TechCrunch is a popular Technology and Business website that enables users to stay up to date with the latest news and events happening in the world. As a Technology lover myself I was fascinated by the opportunity to make the TechCrunch experience better. I chose to explore how we could connect users with the information they love faster, and in an easier and more convenient manner. 

## Design Statement
How might we structure the content of TechCrunch and build interactions that enable users to connect with the information they need and love faster and in a simpler more enjiyable way?

## Competitor analysis
In order to understand the product more in depth and identify areas of focus, I conducted a heuristics evaluation of the site.

I also conducted a usability test with predefined tasks to understand specific issues with the website. You can learn more about the usability test [here.](https://github.com/anerichouhan/dh150-assignment2)

## Contextual Inquiry
In order to understand the needs, motivations, and pains of my users better, I conducted an in depth user interview that can be found [here](https://github.com/anerichouhan/dh150-assignment04/blob/master/README.md)

## Personas & Scenarios
The next step in my process was to document the motivations, needs, and pains uncovered through the contextual interviews into personas and scenarios. I came up with 3 of each and associated them with key tasks to be accomplished through the website. You can learn more [here](https://github.com/anerichouhan/dh150-personas)

## Low fidelity Wireframes
The next step was to scketch up some ideas on what the website flows could look like and how different screens would connect to each other. I also tested the lowfidelity wireframe with the user to gauge if there were issues with it.You can read more [here.](https://github.com/anerichouhan/lowfi_wireflows/blob/master/README.md)

## High Fidelity Wireframes
After combining the feedback I received on the wireframes, I started designing GUIs. I went through several iterations and the final version can be found [here.](https://www.figma.com/proto/V0V8dwrWILpboToyAR4MYm/TechCrunch?node-id=12%3A4&viewport=-184%2C-712%2C0.3589796721935272&scaling=min-zoom)
